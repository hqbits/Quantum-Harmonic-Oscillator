# Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Simulations

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that simulates the quantum harmonic oscillator, a fundamental model in quantum mechanics. The notebook provides visualizations of the wave functions and probability densities for the ground state and excited states.

## Features
- **Schrödinger Equation**: Solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a harmonic oscillator.
- **Wave Functions**: Construct and visualize wave functions for different quantum states using Hermite polynomials.
- **Probability Density**: Plot the probability density functions to illustrate the likelihood of finding a particle at a given position.
- **Ground State and Excited States**: Compare the ground state with higher quantum states to observe the increasing complexity in their behavior.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hqbits/quantum-harmonic-oscillator-simulations.git
